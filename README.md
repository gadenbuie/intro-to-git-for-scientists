# An Introduction to Git for Scientists (And other regular people)

_By [Garrick Aden-Buie](http://garrickadenbuie.com)_

This is a brief introduction to [git] for scientists and other regular people
who don't regularly think about version control and who wouldn't see themselves
as computer scientists or coders.

Fortunately git can be **very helpful**, even to people who only occasionally
have to deal with code or other people.

The problem is that most introductions to git I've seen, don't make it clear
how (or why) git would fit the general researcher's workflow.
The ideal audience for this document are the countless graduate students
I see around me whose work wouldn't *work* without code and who
would greatly benefit from a little version control.

I hope you find this helpful. Feel free to submit any corrections or edits.
